[The Blue Angles!!](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_bYpzJ3Bfg) @ [thunder over new hampshire](https://thunderovernewhampshire.com) 

## Sep 6th 12pm-4pm

302 Newmarket St, Newington, NH 03801

(they start promptly at 12. gates open at 9am)

### Parking:

**Trader Joes parking lot** ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5ScQPgNraCHZWZG19)) | ([OSM](geo:43.0930833,-70.8015556?z=17.0(Map%20Point)))

It's a large shopping center lot, and is a **~15 min walk** to the AF base.
We for sure can do a drop off of those who don't wanna walk

### Deets:

There will be lots of food there, but I dont think they stop you from bringing food (or chairs). (no glass/cans or coolers)
