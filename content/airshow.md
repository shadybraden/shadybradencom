# Who's ready for the next airshow!

[The Blue Angles!!](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_bYpzJ3Bfg) @ [thunder over new hampshire](https://thunderovernewhampshire.com) 

### Sep 6th 12pm-4pm

302 Newmarket St, Newington, NH 03801

(they start promptly at 12. gates open at 9am)

#### Parking:

**SOLD OUT** of all parking, so, i think the best parking that we will be the least likely to get towed from is in the **trader joes parking lot**. its a large shopping center lot, and is a **~15 min walk** to the AF base.
we for sure can do a drop off of those who dont wanna walk (i am happy to walk)
also, if anyone has a better idea for parking, please bring it up.

I just got an email saying that they had secured more parking at the mall behind the shopping plaza. This would cost $30 per person though (for a bus pass). Parking there should be free, but is going to be an extra ~8 minute walk, making the above option better. ([read email here](https://shadybraden.com/airshow))

#### Deets:
there will be lots of food there, but i dont think they stop you from bringing food (or chairs). (no glass/cans or coolers)
