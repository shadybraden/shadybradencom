## Hide and seek - Alert the chasers as soon as you pull this card. Choose a building within half a mile of where you are now. Send the chasers its address, turn off your tracker, and then find a hiding place. Once you have chosen a hiding place, you may not move until you are caught or you claim the card. The chasers have half an hour from the time you turn off your tracker to find you. If you last the half hour, the card is claimed. You may wait up to 15 minutes before turning your tracker back on. (send the chasers the whole challenge)
