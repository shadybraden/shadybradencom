//BLUF: CALIFORNIA RECOVERY EFFORTS CONTINUE. INCIDENT IN GEORGIA CAPITOL BUILDING RESULTS IN ARREST OF SENATOR.//

Â -----BEGIN TEARLINE-----

-HomeFront-

California: The Los Angeles wildfires continue as firefighting efforts make gains overnight. Recovery efforts have also continued to expand. Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization has expanded volunteer efforts into San Pedro and Riverside County, in addition to the initial efforts in Pacific Palisades. Regional food banks have continued increased requests for donations to meet the increased demand for services. The World Central Kitchen has also established approximately 20 sites offering hot meals throughout the Los Angeles area.

Georgia: This morning scandal erupted following an incident on the House floor. Senator Colton Moore was arrested following him carrying out his duties as an elected official during the joint session.

-----END TEARLINE-----

Analyst Comments: In Georgia, Senator Moore had been previously banned from entering the House floor by House Speaker Jon Burns, who banned him from entering because Senator Moore did not support naming a building after former Speaker Ralston. Sen. Moore, while speaking his disapproval for this naming of a structure a few weeks ago, allegedly made offensive comments about the late former Speaker Ralston, who was previously embroiled in scandal for allegedly abusing his power as Speaker to protect predators and conceal illicit behavior. Because of his remarks on this matter, Senator Moore was banned from the House floor. However, following the incident it appears as though Senator Moore was indeed allowed to be present during a joint session being held on the House floor, which is what led to him attempting to gain entry as his duties mandate.  
As such, the activities pertaining to Senator Moore of Georgia are largely being considered by many to be beyond the pale of civilized society at large, much less that of an allegedly democratic political system. One elected official banning a peer from their place of work for comments they made last year is generally not in keeping with any sort of normalcy. However, the law enforcement officials loyal to Speaker Burns were more than willing to not just enforce Burns' orders, but also allowed Senator Moore to be physically assaulted by bystanders in the process.
