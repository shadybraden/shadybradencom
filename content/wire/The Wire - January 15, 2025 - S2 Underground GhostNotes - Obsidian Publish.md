//BLUF: PEACE AGREEMENT ALLEGEDLY REACHED IN GAZA. FORMER PRESIDENT YOON ARRESTED IN SOUTH KOREA.//

Â -----BEGIN TEARLINE-----

\-International Events-

South Korea: Following the impeachment of President Yoon a few weeks ago, last night Yoon was arrested for ordering a state of martial law in November.

Middle East: A ceasefire agreement has allegedly been reached between Hamas and Israel. AC: Right now it's too soon to tell if this agreement will hold. Allegedly, this deal will result in the return of Israeli hostages, though the details and specifics of the peace agreement have not yet been made public.

\-HomeFront-

California: The Los Angeles region has had a reprieve from increased fire activity as winds remained comparatively calm overnight. However, Red Flag warnings remain in effect as the increased risk of fire danger is not yet over. Arsonists have continued to start fires since this crisis began, though most of these smaller fires have been extinguished or brought under control quickly.

\-----END TEARLINE-----

Analyst Comments: In South Korea, the Corruption Investigation Office attempted to arrest impeached President Yoon two weeks ago, but was prevented from doing so as a result of a Korean standoff taking place between the police attempting the arrest, and Yoon's Presidential security detail. This standoff resulted in limited scuffles and clashes between these forces. Yesterday however, Yoon was finally convinced to surrender himself without conflict as his home was surrounded by approximately 3,000 police officers.
