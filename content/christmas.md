## The events that "happened" to lead up to Jesus' birth

- *2500BC* post creation an estimated ~1500 years, 8 people survive and everyone else doesn't. Estimated 7B ppl
- *2081BC* God promises the land that Abram is on to his descendents. The land Jesus will be born and die in is promised. 
	- the decendents of Abram will be born of a 90 year old
- *1898BC* for like 300 years, they are just in the promised land and the descendants are multiplying. Seems like Gods plan is right on track....then Joseph gets sold into slavery to the Egyptians, which ends up leading them 100's of miles away
- *1446BC* A bunch of people wander around trying to get to a specific location....it takes over 40 years and somehow they don't kill all of each other, or get wiped out by the MANY waring nations surrounding them
- *1406BC* they walk around a fortified castle in their way and it just falls down
- Then, once they get fairly settled in the land, things were looking good, they were entirely relocated from *722BC* to *537BC*. 
- *474BC* Haman gets jealous and almost wipes out all of the Isrealites

## The birth story

#### Luk 2:1-5a ESV
“In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. 4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5. to be registered with Mary, his betrothed...”
#### Mat 1:18-25 ESV
“Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. 20. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 23. “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,and they shall call his name Immanuel”(which means, God with us). 24. When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, 25. but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."
#### Luk 2:8-11 ESV
“And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. 10. And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy that will be for all the people. 11. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”
#### Luk 2:16 ESV
“And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.”
#### Luk 2:20 ESV
“And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.”
#### Mat 2:1-2 ESV
“Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 2. saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.””
#### Mat 2:11 ESV
“And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.”
