- [How to start](#start)
- [Runners](#runners) job
- [Chasers](#chasers) job
- Misc [Rules](#rules)

---

## Start

Start at a central point. 
For Boston, Shake Shack on Washington St is perfect. 

The goal is to earn points. Points are earned by getting to a POI and by returning to the center point.

## Runners

Split the group into two teams. Select one team to be the Runners. They start the day with **100 coins**. All other coins must be earned with challenges.

***One runner shares their location with the other team.*** 

###### The Runners goal is to go to **one** of the POIs, then get back to the center

When the game starts, the Runners get a 15 minute head start. during this 15 minutes, Runners **cannot** select a challenge

## Chasers

The Chasers are just trying to tag any of the Runners

If **any** of the runners get tagged, the run is over. 

When a tag happens, change teams, and new Runners start from current location.

## Rules

- Coins are preserved, so your coin ballance will remain from round to round.
- Getting to a POI gives you the points listed in the "Points" column. Getting back gives you more points
	- For example: if a POI is 2.1 miles from your starting location, you get 2.1 points once you get to the POI, then if you make it back to the Center, you get the number of points that is the distance from the POI to the center. 
		- So if the distance from POI to center is 1.8 miles, your score will be 2.1+1.8=**3.9**

**If the runners get tagged, teams switch right there. The new runners get a 15 minute head start, and can't do challenges during this time**
