## Starting

Start at a central point. 
For Boston, Shake Shack on Washington St is perfect. 

The goal is to earn points. Points are earned by getting to a POI and by returning to the center point.

## Runners

Split the group into two teams. Select one team to be the Runners. They start the day with **100 coins**. All other coins must be earned with challenges.

***One runner shares their location with the other team.*** 

### The Runners goal is to go to **one** of the POIs, then get back to the Center

When the game starts, the Runners get a 15 minute head start. during this 15 minutes, Runners **cannot** select a challenge

## Chasers

The Chasers are just trying to tag any of the Runners

If **any** of the runners get tagged, the run is over. 

When a tag happens, change teams, and new Runners start from current location.

## Rules

- Coins are preserved, so your coin ballance will remain from round to round.
- On a tag, roles switch, and the new runners get a 15 minute head start, but cannot do challenges during this time.
- Both teams start with 100 coins, then have to use challenges to earn more.
	- Only the Runners have to use coins to travel

## Points

- Points:
	- See the drawing below.
	- If Red goes from the Center to POI(1) they get 1.5 points.
		- If they get really close to POI(1) but don't make it, 0 points
	- Then they can try to get back to the Center.
	- They get points based on how many miles they make it.
		- In the drawing, they make it 1 mile, but don't get to the center, so they get 1 point
		- Red gets 1.5+1 = ***2.5 points***
	- Now Green starts, but they start from where Red got tagged.
		- They make it to POI(2) so get the number of points that is the distance ***LINEARLY*** or 2 points
		- Then they make it back to the Center, so they get that distance in points
		- Green gets 2+3 = ***5 points***

The app [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) makes measuring distance linearly easy
