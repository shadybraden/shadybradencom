### how to play:

Start at shake shack
Select one team to be the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">chasers</mark> and the other the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runners.</mark> (start with 100 coins)

***one runner shares their location with the chasers.*** 

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runners</mark> start with 100 coins

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runners</mark> goal is to go to *one* of the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">POI's</mark>, then get back (see below) (get a 15 minute head start).

*during this 15 mins, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runners</mark> cannot select a challenge.*

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">chasers</mark> are just trying to tag the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">runners.</mark> 

if ***any*** of the runners get tagged, the run is over. 

change teams, and start from current location.

coins are preserved, so your coin ballance will remain from round to round.


*getting to a poi gives you the points listed in the "Points:" column. *

if you go from a random location to the poi, and back to shake shack, then you get the points of the distance traveled (in a line).

so if it was 1 mile to the poi, and 2 miles to shake shack, you get 3 points.


if the runners make it back to shake shack with the item from the POI, they win and get the number of points that is the number of (linear) miles to the POI and back. (i.e. if you got to wegmans (3.8) and get back to shake shack, that would be 7.6 pts).

**if the runners get tagged, then it switches teams right there. the new runners get a 15 minute head start.**
