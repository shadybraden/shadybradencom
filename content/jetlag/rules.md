## Start

Start at a central point. 
For Boston, Shake Shack on Washington St is perfect. 

The goal is to earn points. Points are earned by getting to a POI and by returning to the center point.

## Runners

Split the group into two teams. Select one team to be the Runners. They start the day with **100 coins**. All other coins must be earned with challenges.

***One runner shares their location with the other team.*** 

###### The Runners goal is to go to **one** of the POIs, then get back to the center

When the game starts, the Runners get a 15 minute head start. during this 15 minutes, Runners **cannot** select a challenge

## Chasers

The Chasers are just trying to tag any of the Runners

If ***any*** of the runners get tagged, the run is over. 





change teams, and start from current location.

coins are preserved, so your coin ballance will remain from round to round.


*getting to a poi gives you the points listed in the "Points:" column. *

if you go from a random location to the poi, and back to shake shack, then you get the points of the distance traveled (in a line).

so if it was 1 mile to the poi, and 2 miles to shake shack, you get 3 points.


if the runners make it back to shake shack with the item from the POI, they win and get the number of points that is the number of (linear) miles to the POI and back. (i.e. if you got to wegmans (3.8) and get back to shake shack, that would be 7.6 pts).

**if the runners get tagged, then it switches teams right there. the new runners get a 15 minute head start.**
